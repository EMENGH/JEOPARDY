# the original statement. The game begins when a player selects a category and a price cell (button)
# on the screen. player is presented at that point with a statement and 4 possible matches in the form
# of a question. when player selects one of the possible matches, the game display a message stating the
# selection was correct or incorrect. if the selection was correct then the price is then added to an
# accummulator. otherwise it will be deducted from the total. 
# the game ends when all the buttons have been selected.
# player can click on the reset/restart button at anytime to initiate another game. 
# the variation in prices on the board corresponds to the difficulty of the question.
